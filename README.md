# Introduction

EduVR allows everyone to create unlimited 2D & 3D meetings by minting a passport on-chain. We leverage WebRTC technology to provide free, anonymized, and decentralized meetings. Which allow participants to fully immerse into our VR environment thereby providing an interactive experience.

# Problem Statement
 
We understand that existing meeting software are expensive and often comes with different limitations in the call duration and number of participants, our decision to create a 3D classroom was based on new emerging technologies being developed like the Meta Quest and Apple vision Pro. Also, lot of meeting software have shady privacy policies which include recording meetings with the intent of using it to training or test AI.

# Solution

Our solution is a free, private, decentralized and open 2D and 3D on-chain application that provides an immersive experience, which allow us to incorporate 3D models and element to offer more interactive way for the hosts and participants to engage. Users can fully immerse themselves, and pick their character of their choice and seat position.

# Current Functionalities

We have successfully implemented several features in our 3D classroom using the Open Campus Network, Solidity, React Three Fiber, WebRTC, and WalletConnect These features will allow users to:

- Minting Passport
- Creating 2D and 3D Classroom
- Screen sharing and real-time streaming
- Real-time participant tracking

# Roadmap

- **Phase 1: Prototype**
- Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product
- Phase 3: Beta Launch
- Phase 3: Launch

# Challenges and Lesson During the Hackathon

During the hackathon, we faced several challenges, which we successfully tackled and learned from. Our first challenge was integrating WebRTC, we first detected it wasnâ€™t working on different network due to VPN extension in the browser.

# Conclusion

The development 3D classroom is a significant step forward in creating, interactive user experiences. We used peer-to-peer technologies to differentiate ourselves in the  market, provide users with a unique way to connect, interact, and learn from any anywhere. This is the Future of Education on-chain!
